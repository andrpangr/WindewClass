This is a header only library.                                                

You must have OpenGL in order to use this library.                                                    

You will need to link libgdi32.a , libopengl.a and libglu32.a in order to make it work on CodeBlocks.                      
( for the example : open the project "example" go to project -> build options -> linker setings , click add , click on browse(...) , go into 
  ..codeblocks/mingw/lib and then select the files(libgdi32.a,libopengl.a,libglu32.a) , click ok , click ok again , F9 to build and run and that should be all )

On other IDE's you will have to figure it out for yourself.
